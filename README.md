# Piclure

Piclure is a full stack project built using Nextjs with TypeScript for the frontend and Django with a GraphQL endpoint on the backend.

The default Django user model is used. Users belonging to the group "Admins" can access the admin panel and publish posts and upload pictures, other typical users can like and leave comments.  It is still a work-in-progress.
